            The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for
            positive utility is having more negative damage to society than we
            can fathom. This article is going to help detail why, and detail our
            solution in progress.

          <p class="mt-5">
            As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an
            intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in many
            forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest
            status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury
            goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status
            symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of
            status. It has become such common Christmas list item for broke
            young teenagers that the richest man on the planet at the time of
            this writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods
            representing nothing more than the ability to waste money.
            Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service to
            others) is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive
            culture than we can imagine.

            Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could
            be used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves
            and others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a
            false form of

            cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the
            capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species.
            Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off
            spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the
            world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the wealth of
            designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new
            alignment would have.

              redistribution of wealth at scale, we must effectively influence

              failed at building a society which healthily distributes

              responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not
              supporting doing good as the highest form of status. We have more
              than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and
              a culture that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity

            On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in
            food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money
            on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status
            is where a majority of surplus wealth goes.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating
            a better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea to change
            what we cultural see as status has been referred to as ‚ÄúStatus
            Engineering‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves
            and our ideals/values. What your role model wears, or any person of
            influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or
            adults mind.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold mt-14">
            Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra
            for a certain brand of T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-20">
            The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an
            individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in
            society and a tool for respect attribution. That‚Äôs why you see Dior
            shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status
            from spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term value than
            things like first class because we are playing the game of
            unenlightened capitalism.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100
            and does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is not a
            failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we
            do not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal
            house in Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent
            structure for someone for this amount). We need higher forms of
            status to exist in order to progress our culture which will aid in
            the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic level.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial
            status seems become recognized for their tackiness and buying status
            will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently,
            we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we
            are, <a class="font-semibold">the clothing we wear</a>, we display 0
            creativity or care for the world in spending and instead promote
            wasting wealth for the sake of power/leverage over others, and then
            we wonder why society is misaligned to building a healthy world.
            Fashion, what we wear, is the biggest signal we have in representing
            our identity and values.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-12">
            If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we
            can not only change the money used to buy status into doing good for
            the world, but we can change our core representation of status in
            society towards doing good.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real
            impact in realigning our culture towards true status, the amount of
            funds in status spending that could be redirected towards positive
            causes is also no joke.

            hyper decrease in the cost of building.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-12">
            The people who recognize this shift will do well to mortgage their
            house, buying a larger plot of land somewhere.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            If super-intelligence is democratic, honoring that ownership of land
            will be a decision the world makes. (Clearly the idea that those who
            hoarded their wealth and tried to hold on to value should have more
            value than those who put their wealth to work, giving up their
            assets, is one that will be a hard attempt) Propaganda for people to
            relinquish their assets to funds more of the poverty of the world
            will help the world make this decision when the time comes.

            What actually makes one house better than the other (often its
            simply the status it has rather than utility) if it was all about
            utility people would buy the cheaper house and install the heated
            seat toilets, and floors etc. (but then how would people respect
            them more?). What if we were not ranked by the size of our house,
            but instead by the size of our donations.

            You may remember that app that was $999 called ‚ÄúIm rich‚Äù and did
            nothing. That‚Äôs what designer clothing represents today. Useless
            expense for materials with patterns that represent pure vanity. Pure
            spending power gone to pure status.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            It is tasteless‚Ä¶. and we believe society is not only waking up to
            that fact, but it is inevitable that we will create better
            alternatives.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style goods
            declining while a push for understated looks are coming forward.
            Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more oversaturated, and
            pieces that lack design besides the plastery of the luxury logo on
            the piece are seen as tacky.
          </p>
          <p class="py-5">Evidence of this:</p>
          <div>
            <div>Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip.</div>
            <div>Designer brands that are in your face are not it.</div>
          </div>
          <p class="mt-5">Designer that‚Äôs low-key is now the trend.</p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Designer is dialing back as consumers replace spending to these
            models.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            We believe the changing of status starting at a clothing level will
            cause one of the largest wealth flow transfers towards good for the
            world. Imagine an individual who is struggling to provide for
            themselves, eventually however, they begin to thrive. They start a
            business and after having major success exit for a few million
            dollars. What is the standard look and lifestyle of this person
            after this event?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            For the most part, most people are living to keep their ‚Äúsocial
            survival mammoth‚Äù feeling good. This is the part of the brain which
            feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social
            hierarchy. And this is not something I believe we can change, people
            WILL naturally compete to go up the chain of the social hierarchy,
            people want to outdo each other, people are competitive, people are
            different and respect should be given where it is due.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-12">
            This climb, this fight up the ladder is not inherently bad, what's
            wrong right now is what we consider to be markers of people who are
            higher up that ladder. We have been sold a narrative by the luxury
            and designer corporations, who have massive budgets to win the
            celebrities over, that designer and luxury clothing IS high status.
            Those who spend $4k on a designer bag versus one of equivalent
            quality for $50 are put higher on the status scale. If we can
            collectively redefine this status symbol as tacky, which has already
            been changing for in-your-face luxury design brand styles, we will
            change where the money which pays for status goes.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-14">
            While projects like Shelter NFT would build a home for a family who
            would have otherwise never had one before for the same price as a
            designer bag, it is no replacement for a BAG. People still want to
            buy a high end item, so instead, a brand which offers that price of
            bag, that level of quality, whose surplus funds goes towards making
            that positive change is perfect.
